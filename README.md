Introduction
------------
Ajasta is a simple invoicing application built with the latest technologies on
the market. It comes with a simple client and project management, allows you to
quickly create new invoices and send them to you clients as PDFs. A templating
system allows you to have your invoices look exactly the way you want them to.

The project is currently under a complete rewrite, but will mature quickly.
