This is a limited export of CLDR locales supported by this application. We only
need the XML files of locales used in the user interface, not for printed PDFs.

When updating or adding files here, take them from the "core.zip" file of the
CLDR release. They are usually located in the "/common/main/" directory in the
ZIP file. When adding a full locale here (e.g. "en_US"), make sure to also add
the base locale (e.g. "en").

CLDR version of the export: 25
